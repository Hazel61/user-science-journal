                    <p>For my third post I want to write about the importance of user testing and provide some examples
                        from my own data. I think it is reasonable to expect that websites for businesses will include a
                        description of their product, hours of operation and location, and these features should be
                        prominent without the need for too much scrolling or searching. I feel restaurants have the
                        additional requirement of including mouthwatering pictures of their product as soon as possible
                        on their main page.</p>
                    <p>User testing allows us to test our intuition about the major problems with a website by having
                        other eyes review it. It is helpful to include a wide demographic of age, computer ability, and
                        gender in your testing pool, and I guarantee you will find additional user issues in the
                        process.</p>
                    <p> The website I reviewed is the main site for <a href="https://www.seawolfbakers.com/"
                            target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sea Wolf Bakers</a>, a Seattle Bakery so popular that there is a line that
                        snakes out the door on Saturday morning. Sea Wolf uses Squarespace to host and build their
                        website; Squarespace is similar to Wordpress in that it can be used by people with little
                        knowledge of web technologies. They also provide templates and drag/drop menus, but are not open
                        source. In full disclosure, I have been in Sea Wolf's Saturday line repeatedly, as I love their
                        cinnamon rolls. Some examples of the website are shown below.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">My First Impressions</h2>
                    <p>
                        After spending some time on the site reviewing its visual appeal, architecture, and components,
                        my overall impression is positive, but some items could use tweaking. My findings are summarized
                        below.
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">My Impressions</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The pictures are of high quality but sometimes are faded out in the background and hard to
                            see.</li>
                        <li>The main page has a logo, the bakery's name, and a nav bar where a viewer would expect them
                            to be.</li>
                        <li>Account and login utilities are not present but not necessary.</li>
                        <li>A search option in the top nav bar is missing and would be useful.</li>
                        <li>Many links to the website are buried at the bottom of the page in the footer, including a
                            search field and quick links.</li>
                        <li>Links are not always clear.</li>
                        <li>Sea Wolf's address and hours are buried at the bottom of the page and in the "Contact" menu
                            item.</li>
                        <li>Text is not always at a high enough contrast to the background image.</li>
                        <li>My overall impression is that time has been put into the website but modern design is
                            sometimes being chosen over function. It is also possible that Squarespace is not providing
                            enough web development feedback to their customers. </li>
                    </ol>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">The Test Subjects.</h2>
                    <p>The three test subjects I used for this website were a twenty year old very bright female
                        university student, a thirty-five year old male web developer, and a 79 year old retired woman.
                        The differences in their computer ability and knowledge was taken into account, but they still
                        all agreed on the points below. My seventy-nine year old subject had far less expectations of
                        both her ability to navigate and expected clarity of the website; my younger test subjects were
                        much more insistent that the website had flaws. </p>
                    <h3 class="section-heading">The Points They Agreed On.</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>How to find the bakery and what hours they are open should be moved to the top of the main
                            page.</li>
                        <li>Text should have more contrast to the background image, should follow a hierarchy of font
                            sizes, some is too small to read easily.</li>
                        <li>The pictures in the carousel are links, but it is not obvious where to click. You can't
                            click on the text.</li>
                        <li>A search option in the top nav bar is missing and would be useful.</li>
                        <li>The main page has important information buried at the bottom with less important information
                            higher up that could be moved to another page.</li>
                        <li>Pictures in the background are sometimes a distraction.</li>
                        <li>They have a menu, but it is a pdf that opens in another tab. My older subject needed help
                            getting back to the website.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h3 class="section-heading">Additional Points and Comments</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The font for the headers is wonderful and very readable.</li>
                        <li>Following a link to the classes brings you to another website, which then shows all classes
                            are full. There is not a waitlist available or a way to be informed about upcoming classes.
                        </li>
                        <li>Link to wholesale options informs they are not taking wholesale custormers at this time.
                            There is a waitlist form but you have to scroll down to find it.</li>
                        <li>A lovely gallery of product pictures is found through a link in the footer ("inside the
                            bakery") but none of my test subjects found it.</li>
                        <li>It would be easy to add a "where to find us" option in the top menu, instead that
                            information is in "contact".</li>
                        <li>The link to place an order dials a phone number, and this should be restricted to mobile
                            devices.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h3 class="section-heading">Summary</h3>
                    <p>The usability issues of this website are not huge and it would not take too much effort to fix
                        them. When asked what the three most crucial issues are, my younger subjects were much more
                        demanding but all three agreed the most pressing issues were: the address and hours of operation
                        being more prominent, the text being displayed with more background contrast in places and some
                        font sizes increased, and the quick links in the footer repositioned higher. However, this
                        website was created with a template and without an ability and skill to modify it, these may be
                        losing arguments. Overall this is a modern website with large full-width pictures and it
                        translates nicely to mobile. I would start with the address/hours and text visibility issues and
                        go from there.</p>
