                <div class="col-lg-8 col-md-10 mx-auto">
                    <p>For my second post I would like to discuss the website for the high-end outdoor clothing company,
                        North Face,
                        <a href="https://www.thenorthface.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">thenorthface.com.</a>
                        One of the most important components of web design is clear navigation from the home page to all
                        other pages and back, and an understanding of where you are on the website at any time. Although
                        North Face has designed a website
                        with a well-thought-out series of menus to help navigation, I feel some of their design choices,
                        especially the title of their
                        new clothing collection, are going to confuse potential customers.
                    </p>
                    <p>My criteria for a good navigation system has been influenced by Steve Krug, author of "Don't Make
                        Me Think", and usability.gov's
                        guidelines "User Interface Design Basics". Links to both of these resources are found at the end
                        of this article.
                        The five questions both authors feel you should be able to answer at any time are:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Whose page am I on? (site name)</li>
                        <li>What page am I on? (page name)</li>
                        <li>Can I find my way to what I am looking for? (clear consistent navigation)</li>
                        <li>Is it easy to back up or go home?</li>
                        <li>Where is the search button?</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Navigation</h2>
                    <p>I am going to start with the clarity and usefulness of top nav bar, pictured below.</p>

                    <a href="#">
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="img/NorthFaceNav.png"
                            alt="A screen capture of the Nav Bar of North Face's website">
                    </a>
                    <span class="caption text-muted">Northface.com</span>

                    <p>As you can see, the home page of the North Face website has a logo in the left-hand corner where
                        you would expect it, a navigation menu across the middle, and utilities on the top right. Ignore
                        what is below the top bar for now, we will get to the problematic header underneath it in a
                        minute.</p>
                    <p>The North Face logo is the home button throughout the website, and although it is not labeled as
                        such, I think more people know the logo is a good place to start. Each of the main menu items
                        show in the middle portion, and all but the last of those items show a drop down menu on hover,
                        see screen shot below.</p>
                    <a href="#">
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="img/NF-dropdown.png"
                            alt="A screen capture of the Nav Bar dropdown menu of North Face's website">
                    </a>
                    <span class="caption text-muted">Northface.com, dropdown</span>

                    <p></p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Navigating within the site.</h2>
                    <p>Clicking on the first menu item, "Men's", notice that the title of the page selected has turned
                        from black to red (shown above), a good design feature. If you click on the Men's menu option,
                        the navigation also changes to reflect where you are, with a new secondary navigation bar that
                        identifies the page you are on and sub-menu's within it. This is a feature I particularly
                        appreciate in clothing websites because it makes it easy get where you want to go without
                        hunting through the large amount of items in the drop down.

                        <a href="#">
                            <img class="img-fluid" src="img/NF-Men's-menu.png"
                                alt="A screen capture of the North Face Men's page">
                        </a>
                        <span class="caption text-muted">Men's menu option, North Face</span>

                        <p>Clicking on the first option of the submenu, "Jackets & Vests", changes the sub-navigation to
                            reflect where you are and where you have been. Where you are is in bold (see below).</p>
                        <a href="#">
                            <img class="img-fluid" src="img/NF-Men's-jackets.png"
                                alt="A screen capture of North Face, Men's Jacket and Vest page">
                        </a>
                        <span class="caption text-muted">North Face, Men's Jackets & Vests.</span>

                        <p>A new sub-menu appears below the last one to help you pare down what is being displayed, and
                            arrows show each of these headers have drop downs. The only detail I would change in the way
                            this page is displayed is to lower the font size of the first category of jackets listed, in
                            this case, Rainware. This title is larger than any other text on the page and is only the
                            first category of jackets shown, you can scroll down to see more but some users might miss
                            this. The navigation system on the main page is consistent across the entire website.</p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Utilities</h2>
                        <p>The top right of the navbar has the most common utilities requested: help finding a store,
                            general help, a login in, a shopping cart, a button to choose a language, and a search
                            field. All these utilities work except for changing the site language, I could not get the
                            popup to function using either a Mac or in Windows.</p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">The Header Problem</h2>

                        <p>North Face's navigation system made it easy to know where I was and how to get to where I
                            wanted to be. It is a terrible thing that all of the great web development that has gone
                            into this website has been derailed by a unfortunate campaign headline given prominence on
                            the page. Here is that header again so you do not have to scroll up.</p>

                        <a href="#">
                            <img class="img-fluid" src="img/NF-FP.png" alt="A screen capture of North Face, main page">
                        </a>
                        <span class="caption text-muted">North Face, Be Right Back</span>
                        <p>As you can see, the largest text on the page are the words "Be Right Back". This text is
                            larger than the logo and the menu items and my so my first impression of this website was
                            that it was down and not functional. I have shown this page to a number of people and their
                            response was the same. I would love feedback on this - does this text make you pause? North
                            Face may have done this deliberately but somehow I don't think so. I will leave you with
                            their 404 page which I inadvertently stumbled on when researching this website as it shows
                            creativity and humor. "Don't let the goats win" could become the next viral meme.</p>
