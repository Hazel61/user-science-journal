                            target="_blank">Sea Wolf Baker's</a> mobile

                    <h2 class="section-heading">The Test Subjects.</h2>
                    <p>I used four test subject for my mobile usability studies, 3 women and 1 man, and they ranged from
                        age
                        18 to 85. Only one of my subjects had been tested with Sea Wolf's desktop version, and I
                        included
                        her to see if familiarity made any difference. All tests were done on an iPhone 6 and recorded
                        using
                        an iphone 8. A sample of the instructions I handed to my test subjects can be found <a
                            href="img/UT-Seawolf-script.pdf">here</a>. This script is based on an sample provided Steve
                        Krug, author of "Don't Make Me Think"; links to this script and Krug's book can be found in the
                        resources section at the end of this report.</p>
                    <h3 class="section-heading">My test questions are listed below.</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Can you find the bakery hours, location, or a way to call/email them?</li>
                        <li>Can you find out where to sign up for classes?</li>
                        <li>Can you find a menu?</li>
                        <li>Can you find a search bar?</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        All of my testers started by reviewing the landing page and being asked to explore without
                        clicking
                        on anything. I asked all of them to talk me through their process and give me feedback. The
                        landing
                        page for Sea Wolf Bakery's mobile site is shown below.
                    </p>
                    <div class="screen-shot">
                        <h4 class="picture-heading">Sea Wolf's Home Page, top, for mobile</h4>
                        <a href="#">
                            <img class="img-fluid" src="img/seawolf-mobile-hamburger.png"
                                alt="A screen capture of the main page for Sea Wolf Bakers's mobile website">
                        </a>
                    </div>
                    <p>Three of my test subjects, Phil, Jack, and Molly (all younger than 40) explored the home page
                        without
                        reading anything but the headers, and all three rapidly scrolled all the way to the bottom, back
                        to
                        the top, and then back to the bottom again in less than 10 seconds. Phil and Molly noticed the
                        hours
                        and address at the very bottom without being prompted, but Jack missed it. All three younger
                        users
                        noticed the hamburger, the menu link, and the "call now" button because they are used to looking
                        for
                        hamburgers and links. My fourth subject, Evie, an elderly woman, had a hard time realizing there
                        was
                        more content, would pause in her scrolling, and the large sections of text were rather
                        overwhelming
                        for her (there was some screaming). She was not aware there were links on the page, she thought
                        it
                        was all text, and so the first time through she accidentally clicked on a link and went to the
                        Book
                        Larder's website and had to be helped back. My elderly subject also noticed the address at the
                        bottom when she finally got there, mostly because she was reading everything and is observant.
                        Her
                        initial exploring process took about 15 minutes. </p>
                    <p> All of my test subjects remarked on the relaxing colors on the home page and
                        Wolf-with-the-hole-in-the-middle logo, "why is there a hole in the wolf", "there is a hole in
                        the
                        wolf", etc. (If you care why there is a hole in the wolf, this is a scavenger hunt question.
                        Follow
                        the link to Sea Wolf Bakers website above and see if you can find where the answer is hidden on
                        their website, time yourself, and please send me a report.)</p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">The Questions</h2>
                    <p>
                        The first question I asked my guinea pigs was if they could find the location of the bakery, its
                        hours, and how to contact them. Phil and Molly remembered where they had seen them and quickly
                        scrolled to them in the footer, but the other two were briefly lost. It took Jack about three
                        minutes to find it in the Contact menu item in the hamburger and Evie about a minute to remember
                        where she saw it and about two and a half minutes to scroll to it. Jack admitted he didn't
                        expect to
                        find the information in the footer and expected it to be higher up. Below is a screen shot of
                        the
                        footer in the mobile site. The footer links were largely ignored by all four and were the last
                        to be
                        explored.
                    </p>
                    <div class="screen-shot">
                        <h4 class="picture-heading">Sea Wolf mobile, footer</h4>
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="img/seawolf-footer-mobile.PNG"

                    <p>
                        The picture below shows the sideways slide of the home page to the left and the extended
                        hamburger
                        menu when the hamburger is clicked on.

                    <hr>
                    <h3 class="section-heading">Classes</h3>
                    <p>
                        My second questions was how to find what classes they offer and how to sign up for one. This was
                        the
                        hardest task for all of them, mostly because the link for classes is in the hamburger and then
                        to
                        find what classes are offered you need to scroll to the bottom of the page and click another
                        link.
                        This takes you to The Booklarder's website, which, frankly, is a mess. Booklarder posts classes
                        taught by many different entities and instead of removing full classes from the main page, they
                        simply fade them a little and stamp sold out over the top. The classes are organized by date
                        instead
                        of teachers and it took all three younger testers more than five minutes to find out there are
                        no
                        classes for Sea Wolf available (all filled), but you can add your name to a waitlist after a
                        class
                        is closed. Evie got very confused on the Booklarder's website and had to be helped back again.
                        All
                        four testers thought Sea Wolf should promote and book their own classes. Below is a example of
                        Booklarder's main page.
                    </p>
                    <div class="screen-shot">
                        <h4 class="picture-heading">Booklarder, mobile</h4>
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="img/booklarder-main-mobile.PNG"
                            alt="A screen capture of the Booklarder's mobile website">
                    </div>
                    <h3 class="section-heading">Finding the menu</h3>
                    <p>
                        The third question I asked my group was if they could find a menu. This was an easier task, the
                        younger three pulled it up in less than five seconds and Evie found it in about a minute. She
                        was
                        not sure what to click on but she got it pretty quickly. The link opens a new tab and displays a
                        pdf. All three younger testers thought the menu would look better with pictures and Evie had to
                        be
                        helped back from the new tab.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="section-heading">Find the Search Bar</h3>
                    <p>
                        For my last test I asked my four subjects if they could find the search bar, which is in the
                        footer.
                        All four of my testers went right to it, Evie scrolled a little slower, but I feel the speed at
                        which they found it showed they were all learning and remembering what they saw. It was nice to
                        end
                        on a positive note.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="section-heading">Google test</h3>
                    <p> At the end of my test with humans I used Google's Mobile-Friendly Test on Sea Wolf's mobile
                        website,
                        and found they considered it to be passing. To view Google's conclusions, click <a
